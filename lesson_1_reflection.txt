How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


Did not have to compare the files line by line. Saved time and effort.




How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
Will give us the ability to go back to an earlier version with use.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


Manual commits give you more control on when to commit. Automatic commits could create too many versions.




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


To allow projects in which dependencies are in multiple files.




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


git log will list all the commits within a repository and git diff between 2 commits will provide the details between 2 versions of the file.




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 Less concerned about breaking something in the code with my changes.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


we will use it for version control of the files in the repository.
